I am a researcher working with Prof. Rui Zhang in the Department of Surgery, University of Minnesota Twin Cities. I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2024 advised by [Dr. Korris Chung](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/dr-chung-fu-lai-korris/) and [Dr. Xiao Huang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~xiaohuang/). Before that, I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 2020 and received my Bachelor's degree from Wuhan University (WHU) in 2018.


My research interests include Biomedical Informatics, Electronic Health Records, Large Language Models, AI for Healthcare, Deep Learning, and Graph Neural Networks. 


I am looking for remote collaborators. Please feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in working with me.
